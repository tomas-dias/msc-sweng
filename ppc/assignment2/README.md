# **PPC Assignment 2 Directions**

## **Objective**

The goal of this assignment is to parallelize the process of computing the maximum amount of change that can be returned using only the coins in the coin array.

Note that the size of coins is very irregular (has several 4s and 400s). This mimics the real world scenario of having 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 cents coins.

A single-threaded version of the recursive algorithm is provided. You are not supposed to use a more efficient algorithm, you are just supposed to write a parallel version of this one.

## **Report**

You should submit a half-page report detailing what was the parallelization strategy and why. You should also address the issue of granularity explaining which method you have used and why.
