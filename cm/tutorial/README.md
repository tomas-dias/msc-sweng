# **CM Tutorial Project**

## **Features**

- Splash screen with timer.

- Menu entry called “About”, that show group members.

- Paintable canvas (fragment).

- Palette (fragment).

- In portrait, you only see the canvas; in landscape you see both fragments side by side.

- Low-level touch events and gesture detector (strokes may have different colors and are not erased when you change orientation).

- The canvas is cleared when you shake the device (with a fine-tuned threshold so that it doesn't erase when you move it while using or walking).

- You change the color of the background depending on alignment with each axis.

- Menu entry called "Map", that shows you a Google Map (centered in your current location).

## **In Future**

- You increase the brightness of the canvas when the device is in a darker room.

- Add a button that says "Start Drawing" that changes to "Stop Drawing", when pressed (and vice-versa).

- Draw a polyline with your location updates when you are in drawing mode.

- Firebase integration.
